# PEPP-PT Documentation

## What is PEPP-PT?

The purpose of the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT)
approach is to provide a common basis for management systems that can be
integrated into national public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The
PEPP-PT approach is being created by a multi-national European team.  It is
a privacy-preserving digital proximity-tracing approach, which is in full
compliance with GDPR and can also be used when traveling between countries.

## Documentation

- [PEPP-PT High-Level Overview](./PEPP-PT-high-level-overview.pdf)
- [PEPP-PT Building Blocks for Pandemic Management Systems using Proximity Tracing](./PEPP-PT-building-blocks.pdf)
- [PEPP-PT Data Protection and Information Security Architecture: Illustrated on German Implementation](./PEPP-PT-data-protection-information-security-architecture.pdf)

The building blocks will be published as separate documents step by step as we
complete the editing process.

## Open source strategy

PEPP-PT is preparing a number of source code repositories to be open sourced.

These repositories contain the complete and comprehensive code (including full documentation and code for testing) and configurations of all backends, frontends, apps, applications, administrator frontends and other tools, such as:

* Backend services
* Android application core libraries
* Android application reference implementation
* iOS application core libraries
* iOS application reference implementation

We will release the code under such an [OSI certified](https://opensource.org/licenses) open source license that requires disclosure of the code of derived works, like the [European Union Public License](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Public_Licence) (EUPL) or [GNU General Public License](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) (GPL).

As is usual with open-source software, we will conduct an open development process and not just publish finished code. This also applies to the definition of milestones and goals as well as to conceptual and strategic activities.

Our goal when open sourcing the code is to be transparent and establish
a dialog with the community.  Through this transparency and ongoing discussion,
our hope is to build trust and ensure any concerns raised are resolved before
solutions based on PEPP-PT are released to the general public.

## Contributing

The project welcomes contributions. We will release a Community Code of Conduct based on [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) soon.
